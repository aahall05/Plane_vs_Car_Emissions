COP3530 Project 3
Instructions for running program:  
*run main, it will prompt for year make and model  
*it must follow that order with a space in between year and make, and make and model. Anything that follows the space after 'make' will be included in the 'model'  
*I included a specific model's trim level/engine size in the model variable, but it will have to match the data set exactly so here are 10 inputs that are guaranteed to be in the set  
2011 Dodge Nitro Heat 4.0  
2010 Porsche Cayenne Turbo  
2011 Chevrolet HHR Wagon LS AT  
2011 Jeep Liberty Sport 70th Anniversary 4x2  
2023 Make3 Model66 Trim66  
1972 Make600 Model91 Trim91  
2023 make3 model66 trim66  
2010 Saab 9-3 2.0T Aero Sport Sedan XWD  
2011 Buick Lucerne CXL Premium  
2012 Subaru Impreza Sedan 2.0i Premium PZEV  
*I randomly generated 95,000 cars to fill out the set, generating the year, make, model, city mpg and highway mpg for each. the rest of the data in each line is the same and acts as a placeholder to match the set's format.
